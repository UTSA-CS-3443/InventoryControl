Inventory Control is a simple to use interactive inventory tracking app, 
that will allow users to easily create and interact with them into a list 
in an inutitive yet informative manner. It allows you to keep track 
of items and how much they cost. It includes four features: the create feature,
the view feature, the update feature, and the delete feature. The create feature allows
you to create an item, how much they cost, and how many there are. The view feature
allows you to view your list of items and all the details. The update feature allows 
you to update an item, either by the item ID or by searching the item manually. And the 
delete feature allows you to delete an item, also either by the item ID or by searching 
the item manually.
